        ✔ num components in window @done(19-03-27 12:28)

    ☐  contextual strack
        ☐ show only if other track is selected
            drumbus (if fx bus / pad fx)
            la
        ☐ get contexts
            on track selection change, change contexts


    ✔ move eventloop outside window @done(19-03-27 12:28)
        app
            keyboard

        ☐ name
        ☐ icons
