Ideas:
    ☐ profiler
        ☐ num components
        ☐ num components in window
    ☐  contextual strack
        ☐ show only if other track is selected
            drumbus (if fx bus / pad fx)
            la
        ☐ get contexts
            on track selection change, change contexts

    ☐ move eventloop outside window
        app
            keyboard
            app quit
        window
            mouse
            paint
            option quit on close ?

    ☐ Selection set to have unified selection bhaviour
        ☐ set has drive by existing set
        ☐ replicate reaper behavior

    ☐ sync midiSlaveTracks
        ☐ name
        ☐ icons
        keep sync while name begins with ->
    ☐ instrument rack
        show all tracks that have neither tcp nor mcp
        add midi track
        add multiouts
        edit
        higlight when midi track is selected
    ☐ change label to have text or image content
        ☐ remove iconbutton in favour of general button

Bugx:
    ☐ random sound if db file is missing
