Ideas:

    ☐ Selection set to have unified selection bhaviour
        ☐ set has drive by existing set
        ☐ replicate reaper behavior

    ☐ sync midiSlaveTracks
        ☐ name
        ☐ icons
        keep sync while name begins with ->
    ☐ instrument rack
        show all tracks that have neither tcp nor mcp
        add midi track
        add multiouts
        edit
        higlight when midi track is selected
    ☐ change label to have text or image content
        ☐ remove iconbutton in favour of general button

Bugx:
    ☐ random sound if db file is missing
